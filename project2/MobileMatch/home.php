			<h3>XIAOMI 11 LITE 5G NE</h3>
			<p>The Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE is an incredibly inexpensive smartphone
				that's surprisingly good at capturing images and it looks pretty
				slim too. It's a good mid-range smartphone but it does have plenty
				of competition at this price point so does face a challenge when
				looking for buyers.</p>

			<h3>SAMSUNG GALAXY A54</h3>
			<p>The Samsung Galaxy A54 is a solid mid-ranger that ticks most
				boxes. It has a great display, premium build, a decent camera setup
				and a large battery but slight performance niggles and inconsistent
				battery life stop it from being an instant recommendation.</p>
